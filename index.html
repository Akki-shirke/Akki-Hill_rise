<h1>Salads

</h1>

<p>
    You can either go for a ready-made salad bowl that is available in the supermarkets or you can make it more
    delicious and filling with my tricks. All you need is a pack of ready-made salad that has greens, some veggies, nuts
    and dressing. Along with that you need canned chickpeas, kidney beans or any other beans available. I would suggest
    to buy some more veggies and fruits for the salad like cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, grapes, and berries. Assemble
    everything and your meal is ready. Season with salt and pepper if needed.

<h1>Mix Veg Pulao with Salad

</h1>

<p>
    This seems really comforting like a home-cooked meal. Right? To make this you will need a pack of Ready-to-Eat
    Seasoned Rice. When the rice is already seasoned, you don’t need to buy separate spices to add flavours. You will
    also need a pack of frozen veggies because they get cooked even in microwave. These days it is easy to get a pack of
    mixed veggies that includes brocolli, celery, corns, bell peppers, etc. Apart from that you may need salt and some
    cooking oil too.

</p>

<h1>
    Mix Veg Pasta Arrabiata
</h1>

<p>
    Hell Yeah! You can make this using a kettle or a microwave. For this, you will need a pack of Pasta, frozen veggies,
    and Arrabiata Sauce (ready made). To make this, mix boiled pasta, arrabiata sauce and frozen veggies. If you have
    cheeze, add that too. Heat in the microwave for a couple of minutes so that all the flavors are well combined. Serve
    with some toasted bread.

<h1>
    Avocado-Feta Sandwich
</h1>

<p>
    This is something that you can enjoy for a quick breakfast or even for a meal on-the-go. You can follow the recipe
    of my Avocado-Feta Sandwich. You can even skip avocado and feta and simply use ready-made guacamole. These days it
    is easier to get guacamole on the fridge section of a supermarket.

<p>
    I am extremely proud to create this recipe in 5-10 minutes. All you need is Instant Mexican Rice (or any other

    need a pack of fruit yogurt, granola or crunchy musli, some fresh fruits and berries of choice. Assemble everything
    together and your meal is ready.
